# Design additions

We welcome new design suggestions, when creating design specifications try to be as specific as possible. This can be in terms of the 
visual output but also the expected HTML. 

When designing new features please keep in mind the following critera:
- Easy to use and learn (should not get in the way of the user)
- Cannot interfere with other tags 
- Must be backwards compatable with previous versions of the OpenBook interperter
- Must be as accessible as possible we use WAVE (https://wave.webaim.org/) as a tool to check for accessibility compliance
- Consider your design in the context of education will this assist instructors creating material or students learning it?
