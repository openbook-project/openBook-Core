#par# Syntax for OpenBooks is defined by hashtags, hashtags were chosen because they are unary symbol thats easy to see. Tokens can be written inside the pair of hashtags 
examples are par, img, link... Options are delimted by a pipe symbol '|'. There are two types of options, commands and parameters. Commands are single words that can apply to multiple different tags. Parameters are more specific and require what you are specifying along with the specific action. Here are some examples :

#bold# centered par #end#
#code#
	\#par | center\# content here ...
#end# 

#bold# image with alt text and a src #end#
#code# 
	\#img | src = URL (can be a link or file location)
	 alt= alt text (used for screen-readers) \#
#end#

#par# Since the hashtag is reserved, you can escape it with a backslash to print it without entering a new tag e.g '\\\#' results in \#

#big# Paragraph Tags #end#
#code#
	\#par\# content here...
#end#

#break#

#par# Accepts the following options
#list#
#item# Left, Center, Right
#end#

#break#

#big# Images #end#
#code#
	\#img | src = src_url\#
#end#

#par# images display pictures and gifs. They can either be local files (internal) or 
links (external). By default images are searched in the media folder generated by OpenBooks.

#emph# Note: the extension is optional, OpenBooks will target matching file basenames if an extension is not specified 
#end#

#par#
To look outside of the media folder, you can enter an absolute path 

#emph# Note: web versions of the compiler are expected to restrict this for security reasons #end#  

#bold# Accepts the following options #end#

#list#
#item# Left, Center, Right 
#item# src = src_url (this is required)
#item# alt = alt_text used for screen readers, by default the alt text will be extracted
from the file name
#end#
