goal:
	replace the tradional physical textbook & ebook
	make learning complex material easier through a more interactive medium
	learn anything for free!
	wikipedia model - let anyone contribute and verify instead of only (paid) authors

why this is important:
	textbooks cost a lot! continue increasing costs
	alternatives are eBooks, PDFS, websites (we can do better!)
		=> see medium advantage below
	clases are getting bigger defer some teaching to the book itself
	profs can edit as they please - custom books for each course
	always be updated without charge! git pull does this why can't ebooks?

features:
	hyperlinked content
	index everywhere feature e.g:
		instead of opening the appendex/index of a real book or simply changing
		the page in an ebook, 
		open an iframe with relevent info right there!
	embed images/video/gifs...etc.
	embed interactive demos => unity, HTML5canvas, etc...
	embed programming exercises => powered by Submitty
	annotations e.g:
		proofs typically skip a lot of steps because people who know what they're 
		doing can skip them, but confusing for new users
		solution: allow "annotations" which reveal additional steps/info to help
		new people without making proofs/info to long to read

future goals:
	digital "library" to share sBooks
	allow "forks" and "remixes" kinda like git (submitty hub lol)
	auto-generated problems? (for cs & math)
		=> CS1 would be a good problem space to test this,
			exercises simple - easier to create?
			they cannot be looked up or copied

technical:
	probably python (maybe c++ - barbs)
	build an interperture for simple config to a nicely formated "book"
	method to link inbetween books, eg. grab diagram/chapter from someone else
	build way to test user input to submitty (or locally if possible) for CS



index everywhere feature:
	-----------------	-----------------
	|		|	|	--------|
	| <LINK>	|  ==>  |       |<INFO>|| 
	|	^	|	|	--------|	
	-----------------	-----------------

However this can be "infinite"! for example the info page can also have links that 
open new "frames" which also have links and so on and so on.

E.g:
	A chapter on maps could link to tree which could link to ptrs, memory, etc
	If a student forgets any of these can quickly parse all relevent material

I like the idea of parsing a file to HTML/CSS/JS. This is the closest thing to a platform-
independent application and we can also utalize progressive web apps ;) 

Also naming this is kinda hard
smartBooks     	<kinda vague>
openBook(s)     <doesn't really convey the message>
submittyBooks   <do we want to be tied down to submitty - this should be for any subject>
shailBooks      <yessss>
hyperBooks	<selmy>
RPIopencourseware <a few others do this like MITocw, Standford ocw>
I think my fav so far is openBook

medium advantage:
	From the book the Medium is the Message:
	Certain forms of media are more engaging than others, while some are more passive
	than others. Some can also convey more information than others

	Passiveness (10 most passive)
	0 <=============================================================> 10
	|	|			|		   |		|
	|	|			us!	           |		video/TV
	books	|					   lectures
		videogames	

	Books and videogames 					Video/Tv doesn't need you
	require engagement,					You can pay attention or 
	you cant use a book					not and the video moves
	without putting effort					along
	same with video games


	Engaging (10 being the most interesting)
	0 <==============================================================> 10
		|      |                |			|         |
		books  |                us!                     video     videogames
		       lecture

	Its easy to loose attention				video/videogames are  
	to books & lecture,					way more interesting!
	especially today!					the brain likes motion

	Information (10 being the most info dense)
	0 <===============================================================> 10
		|		|					| |
		videogames	|					| books
				video					lecture
									  us!
	Video games typically					   Lots of info!
	require more work per					 Each word is a unit of info
	amount of info shown
	same with video. It is
	easy to show simple ideas
	but doesn't scale with complexity

	From this: 
		books & lecture are info dense but not engaging as other media
		Video and videogames are engaging but can't express as much info
		How about a happy medium?
			Sections that can express info like books
			Capture engagement using interactive sections
				=> demos, videos, games, exercises		
			Utalize submitty - e.g you must complete these 3 exercises 
			as a grade => this can help reduce passivness
